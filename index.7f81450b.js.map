There\\u{2019}s an old adage that says you can\\u{2019}t\r\n                manage time, but you can manage your actions. This sentiment\r\n                holds the key to productivity: making small, intentional changes\r\n                to your habits to focus on what truly matters.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"test\">\r\n                <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                The goal of effective time management is not to cram more tasks\r\n                into your day but to prioritize the right tasks\\u{2014}the ones that\r\n                drive meaningful results. By doing so, you\\u{2019}ll not only feel more\r\n                fulfilled but also experience benefits like career growth,\r\n                financial rewards, or simply a bit of extra free time. Think you\r\n                don\\u{2019}t have time to improve your time management skills? Think\r\n                again! Here are six practical strategies to tweak your habits\r\n                and see real results. 1. Embrace Change with an Open Mind The\r\n                foundation of better time management lies in your willingness to\r\n                change. If you\\u{2019}re resistant to trying new approaches, you\\u{2019}ll\r\n                remain stuck in old patterns that don\\u{2019}t serve you. Begin by\r\n                acknowledging that your current habits might need adjustment,\r\n                and commit to experimenting with strategies that can help you\r\n                become more efficient and focused. 2. Treat Time Like Money Time\r\n                is your most valuable resource\\u{2014}it\\u{2019}s finite and irreplaceable.\r\n                Unlike money, you can\\u{2019}t earn more of it. You have just 1,440\r\n                minutes each day, so think about how you\\u{2019}re spending them. Are\r\n                you investing your time in activities that align with your goals\r\n                and values? Whether it\\u{2019}s at work or in your personal life, make\r\n                deliberate choices that prioritize what truly matters to you. 3.\r\n                Prioritize Like You\\u{2019}re Going on Vacation Think about how you\r\n                prepare for a vacation. You make a long list of tasks, then\r\n                narrow it down ruthlessly, focusing only on the essentials as\r\n                your departure date approaches. If you applied this mindset\r\n                every day, you\\u{2019}d accomplish far more of what\\u{2019}s important. Start\r\n                each morning by identifying your top three priorities and let go\r\n                of tasks that don\\u{2019}t contribute to significant results. 4. Weigh\r\n                the Consequences Before Saying \\u{201C}Yes\\u{201D} We often agree to new tasks\r\n                without fully considering their impact. The next time someone\r\n                asks for your help, pause and think: What will happen if I don\\u{2019}t\r\n                take on this responsibility? Can I realistically deliver on this\r\n                commitment without compromising my other priorities? By saying\r\n                \\u{201C}No\\u{201D} thoughtfully, you\\u{2019}ll not only protect your time but also\r\n                build a reputation for reliability when you do agree to help. 5.\r\n                Tackle What\\u{2019}s Weighing on Your Mind When unresolved tasks linger\r\n                in your mind, they drain your energy and focus. Whether it\\u{2019}s a\r\n                personal responsibility like fixing your car or a professional\r\n                challenge like completing a complex report, make it your mission\r\n                to address these tasks promptly. Clearing mental clutter allows\r\n                you to redirect your energy toward other meaningful activities.\r\n                6. Use the T.A.R. Principle: Trash, Action, Reference Emails,\r\n                documents, and other information can pile up quickly, creating a\r\n                constant source of distraction. Use the T.A.R. method to\r\n                categorize everything you encounter: Trash: If something is\r\n                irrelevant or unnecessary, discard it immediately. Action: If an\r\n                item requires your attention, identify the next step and add it\r\n                to your to-do list. Reference: If it\\u{2019}s something you may need\r\n                later, file it in an organized system for easy access. This\r\n                system keeps you focused on actionable tasks while reducing time\r\n                spent sifting through clutter. Time management isn\\u{2019}t about\r\n                filling every moment with tasks\\u{2014}it\\u{2019}s about aligning your actions\r\n                with your values and goals. Small, consistent changes to how you\r\n                approach your day can lead to significant improvements in both\r\n                productivity and satisfaction. Remember, the goal isn\\u{2019}t just to\r\n                do more but to do what matters most. By adopting these six\r\n                golden rules, you\\u{2019}ll take control of your time and create a more\r\n                balanced, fulfilling life.\r\n              </p>\r\n              </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </article>\r\n    `;\nconst $0057781f4d676bcb$var$markupArticle2 = `\r\n             <img\r\n            srcset=\"\r\n              ${(0, (/*@__PURE__*/$parcel$interopDefault($507bc6b3fc80ef19$exports)))} 1x,\r\n              ${(0, (/*@__PURE__*/$parcel$interopDefault($92cf4acfbb3cdabf$exports)))} 2x\r\n            \"\r\n            src=\"${(0, (/*@__PURE__*/$parcel$interopDefault($507bc6b3fc80ef19$exports)))}\"\r\n            alt=\"notes on the wall\"\r\n            class=\"image-for-article\"\r\n          />\r\n          <article class=\"article-content\">\r\n            <h3 class=\"article-title\">\r\n              Best Time Management Techniques: Find What Works for You.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <article class=\"article-text \">\r\n              <p>\r\n                The key to better time management lies in understanding your\r\n                specific needs\\u{2014}whether you\\u{2019}re looking to organize work tasks,\r\n                streamline study sessions, or focus on personal goals. Below are\r\n                some of the most effective time management techniques you can\r\n                adopt, depending on your unique challenges and aspirations.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                Primarily focused on management tasks. Choose Your Technique The\r\n                best time management method depends on your goals and work\r\n                style. Start with one that resonates with your needs and adapt\r\n                it as necessary. Whether you're focusing on personal growth,\r\n                professional tasks, or team projects, adopting these techniques\r\n                can help you achieve more with less stress. 1. Pomodoro\r\n                Technique The Pomodoro Technique divides your work into\r\n                25-minute focused sessions followed by 5-minute breaks. After\r\n                completing four sessions, you take a longer 15\\u{2013}20 minute break.\r\n                How It Works: Choose a task. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Work on\r\n                the task until the timer rings. Take a 5-minute break. After\r\n                four cycles, enjoy a 20-minute break. Best For: Avoiding\r\n                burnout. Managing distractions. Tackling procrastination. Pros:\r\n                Encourages intense focus. Helps maintain energy levels. Cons:\r\n                Fixed intervals may disrupt creative flow. 2. Kanban Method\r\n                Kanban offers a visual system for tracking tasks through a board\r\n                with columns like To Do, In Progress, and Done. How It Works:\r\n                List all your tasks in the Backlog column. Move tasks to To Do,\r\n                then to In Progress, and finally to Done. Focus on moving tasks\r\n                steadily across the board. Best For: Visual learners. Managing\r\n                multiple ongoing projects. Pros: Clear overview of task status.\r\n                Customizable to suit personal workflows. Cons: Lacks\r\n                time-specific scheduling. 3. Getting Things Done (GTD) This\r\n                method involves capturing and organizing every task to create\r\n                actionable to-do lists. How It Works: Write down all tasks.\r\n                Clarify which tasks are actionable. Organize tasks by context or\r\n                category. Regularly review your lists to update priorities. Act\r\n                on the tasks with clear next steps. Best For: Clearing mental\r\n                clutter. Prioritizing tasks. Pros: Provides structure to your\r\n                workflow. Helps identify next steps for tasks. Cons: Requires\r\n                discipline to review and update lists regularly. 4. Eat That\r\n                Frog This method emphasizes tackling your hardest or most\r\n                important task first. How It Works: Identify your \\u{201C}frog\\u{201D} (the\r\n                task you\\u{2019}re dreading or that has the most impact). Do it first\r\n                thing in the morning. Move on to smaller tasks after completing\r\n                the big one. Best For: Overcoming procrastination. Prioritizing\r\n                high-impact work. Pros: Builds momentum for the rest of the day.\r\n                Simplifies prioritization. Cons: May feel overwhelming to start\r\n                with a challenging task. 5. Timeboxing Timeboxing involves\r\n                assigning specific time slots to tasks. How It Works: List your\r\n                tasks. Allocate a specific amount of time to each task. Stick to\r\n                the schedule. Best For: Breaking large projects into manageable\r\n                chunks. Keeping track of small tasks. Pros: Encourages focus and\r\n                accountability. Helps manage multiple responsibilities. Cons:\r\n                Interruptions can disrupt the schedule. 6. Time Blocking Time\r\n                blocking allocates distinct blocks of time for specific tasks,\r\n                often using a calendar. How It Works: Create a detailed schedule\r\n                in your calendar. Assign blocks of time to tasks based on their\r\n                priority. Include breaks in your schedule. Best For:\r\n                Comprehensive day planning. Focusing on deep work. Pros:\r\n                Encourages focused work. Promotes better control over your day.\r\n                Cons: Requires adjustments for unexpected interruptions. 7.\r\n                Inbox Zero This technique aims to manage your email inbox by\r\n                reducing the number of unread or pending messages to zero. How\r\n                It Works: Schedule specific times to check your inbox. Address\r\n                emails immediately: reply, delete, archive, or delegate.\r\n                Organize emails into folders for action or reference. Best For:\r\n                Keeping email under control. Reducing distraction from constant\r\n                notifications. Pros: Reduces email clutter. Allocates focused\r\n                time for inbox management. Cons: Time-consuming to implement\r\n                fully. 8. Who\\u{2019}s Got the Monkey? This method focuses on\r\n                delegating tasks effectively, making it especially useful for\r\n                managers. How It Works: Identify tasks (\\u{201C}monkeys\\u{201D}) and who\r\n                should handle them. Assign tasks with clear expectations. Follow\r\n                up to ensure progress. Best For: Delegating responsibilities.\r\n                Improving team productivity. Pros: Increases team\r\n                accountability.

The way we\r\n                approach tasks, our habits, and how we deal with\r\n                responsibilities define our time management style. Each style\r\n                has its strengths but also comes with specific challenges.\r\n                Here's an overview of six common time management styles and\r\n                their issues.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                1. Time Martyr Time martyrs prioritize others' needs over their\r\n                own. They often fill their schedules with tasks for others,\r\n                avoiding their own responsibilities, which feel overwhelming.\r\n                This behavior might bring external validation but neglects\r\n                personal growth and satisfaction. Common Issues: Multitasking\r\n                Missed deadlines Ineffective scheduling Skipping breaks 2.\r\n                Procrastinator Procrastinators delay tasks, often claiming they\r\n                work better under pressure. While this approach may sometimes\r\n                yield results, it frequently leads to stress, anxiety, and\r\n                subpar outcomes. Common Issues: Missed deadlines Ineffective\r\n                scheduling Multitasking 3. Distractor Distractors have good\r\n                intentions but struggle with focus. They\\u{2019}re easily sidetracked\r\n                by interruptions, like impromptu chats, phone calls, or\r\n                unplanned tasks, which prevents them from completing their work\r\n                effectively. Common Issues: Multitasking Missed deadlines\r\n                Ineffective scheduling 4. Underestimator Underestimators often\r\n                misjudge how long tasks will take. They optimistically set\r\n                deadlines that are difficult to meet, leading to rushed work and\r\n                unmet expectations. Common Issues: Missed deadlines Ineffective\r\n                scheduling 5. Firefighter Firefighters thrive on urgency and\r\n                constantly put out \"fires\" \\u{2014} tackling problems as they arise.\r\n                While they appear busy and productive, this reactive approach\r\n                can lead to burnout and a lack of focus on long-term goals.\r\n                Common Issues: Missed deadlines Skipping breaks Ineffective\r\n                scheduling 6. Perfectionist Perfectionists strive for flawless\r\n                results, which often makes them overwork tasks. While their\r\n                commitment to quality is admirable, their inability to stop\r\n                tweaking can cause delays, missed deadlines, and even burnout.\r\n                Common Issues: Missed deadlines Skipping breaks How to Overcome\r\n                Challenges Each time management style has room for improvement.\r\n                The key is identifying your challenges and adopting time\r\n                management techniques that address them: Time Martyrs can learn\r\n                to say \\u{201C}no\\u{201D} and prioritize their own tasks using techniques like\r\n                Eat That Frog or Time Blocking. Procrastinators may benefit from\r\n                structured approaches like the Pomodoro Technique to break tasks\r\n                into manageable segments. Distractors can use Timeboxing or\r\n                create focused environments by silencing notifications and\r\n                minimizing interruptions. Under estimators should plan with\r\n                SMART goals, breaking tasks into smaller, realistic steps.\r\n                Firefighters can gain control with visual tools like Kanban\r\n                boards, focusing on long-term priorities. Perfectionists should\r\n                embrace Timeboxing, which sets clear boundaries on how long to\r\n                spend on a task. By recognizing your time management style and\r\n                addressing its pitfalls, you can develop more effective habits\r\n                and achieve a healthier work-life balance.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </article>\r\n         `;\nfunction $0057781f4d676bcb$var$renderArticles() {\n    const articleContainer1 = document.querySelector(\".article-one\");\n    const articleContainer2 = document.querySelector(\".article-two\");\n    const articleContainer3 = document.querySelector(\".article-three\");\n    articleContainer1.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", $0057781f4d676bcb$var$markupArticle1);\n    articleContainer2.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", $0057781f4d676bcb$var$markupArticle2);\n    articleContainer3.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", $0057781f4d676bcb$var$markupArticle3);\n}\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", ()=>{\n    $0057781f4d676bcb$var$renderArticles();\n});\n\n\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.7f81450b.js.map\n","\"use strict\";\n\nvar mapping = new Map();\nfunction register(baseUrl, manifest) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < manifest.length - 1; i += 2) {\n    mapping.set(manifest[i], {\n      baseUrl: baseUrl,\n      path: manifest[i + 1]\n    });\n  }\n}\nfunction resolve(id) {\n  var resolved = mapping.get(id);\n  if (resolved == null) {\n    throw new Error('Could not resolve bundle with id ' + id);\n  }\n  return new URL(resolved.path, resolved.baseUrl).toString();\n}\nmodule.exports.register = register;\nmodule.exports.resolve = resolve;","require('./helpers/bundle-manifest').register(new __parcel__URL__(\"\").toString(),JSON.parse(\"[\\\"ivwOa\\\",\\\"index.7f81450b.js\\\",\\\"1BK5s\\\",\\\"table_mobile_1x.85ae97ab.jpg\\\",\\\"kw9Ut\\\",\\\"table_mobile_2x.4ced3fe3.jpg\\\",\\\"7XMez\\\",\\\"walls_mobile_1x.b55aa355.jpg\\\",\\\"4cinx\\\",\\\"walls_mobile_2x.82a774d1.jpg\\\",\\\"8Ou5Q\\\",\\\"folders_mobile_1x.cc585da2.jpg\\\",\\\"7BQ8x\\\",\\\"folders_mobile_2x.452d39d9.jpg\\\"]\"));","import table_mobile_1x from \"../src/images/table_mobile_1x.jpg\";\nimport table_mobile_2x from \"../src/images/table_mobile_2x.jpg\";\nimport walls_mobile_1x from \"../src/images/walls_mobile_1x.jpg\";\nimport walls_mobile_2x from \"../src/images/walls_mobile_2x.jpg\";\nimport folders_mobile_1x from \"../src/images/folders_mobile_1x.jpg\";\nimport folders_mobile_2x from \"../src/images/folders_mobile_2x.jpg\";\nconst markupArticle1 = `\r\n              <img\r\n            srcset =\"${table_mobile_1x} 1x,\r\n              ${table_mobile_2x} 2x\r\n            \"\r\n            src=\"${table_mobile_1x}\"\r\n            alt=\"notes on the wall\"\r\n            class=\"image-for-article\"\r\n          />\r\n          <article class=\"article-content\">\r\n            <h3 class=\"article-title\">\r\n              Six golden Rules for Better Time Management.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <article class=\"article-text\">\r\n              <p>\r\n                Time management isn’t about controlling the clock—it’s about\r\n                managing yourself. There’s an old adage that says you can’t\r\n                manage time, but you can manage your actions. This sentiment\r\n                holds the key to productivity: making small, intentional changes\r\n                to your habits to focus on what truly matters.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"test\">\r\n                <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                The goal of effective time management is not to cram more tasks\r\n                into your day but to prioritize the right tasks—the ones that\r\n                drive meaningful results. By doing so, you’ll not only feel more\r\n                fulfilled but also experience benefits like career growth,\r\n                financial rewards, or simply a bit of extra free time. Think you\r\n                don’t have time to improve your time management skills? Think\r\n                again! Here are six practical strategies to tweak your habits\r\n                and see real results. 1. Embrace Change with an Open Mind The\r\n                foundation of better time management lies in your willingness to\r\n                change. If you’re resistant to trying new approaches, you’ll\r\n                remain stuck in old patterns that don’t serve you. Begin by\r\n                acknowledging that your current habits might need adjustment,\r\n                and commit to experimenting with strategies that can help you\r\n                become more efficient and focused. 2. Treat Time Like Money Time\r\n                is your most valuable resource—it’s finite and irreplaceable.\r\n                Unlike money, you can’t earn more of it. You have just 1,440\r\n                minutes each day, so think about how you’re spending them. Are\r\n                you investing your time in activities that align with your goals\r\n                and values? Whether it’s at work or in your personal life, make\r\n                deliberate choices that prioritize what truly matters to you. 3.\r\n                Prioritize Like You’re Going on Vacation Think about how you\r\n                prepare for a vacation. You make a long list of tasks, then\r\n                narrow it down ruthlessly, focusing only on the essentials as\r\n                your departure date approaches. If you applied this mindset\r\n                every day, you’d accomplish far more of what’s important. Start\r\n                each morning by identifying your top three priorities and let go\r\n                of tasks that don’t contribute to significant results. 4. Weigh\r\n                the Consequences Before Saying “Yes” We often agree to new tasks\r\n                without fully considering their impact. The next time someone\r\n                asks for your help, pause and think: What will happen if I don’t\r\n                take on this responsibility? Can I realistically deliver on this\r\n                commitment without compromising my other priorities? By saying\r\n                “No” thoughtfully, you’ll not only protect your time but also\r\n                build a reputation for reliability when you do agree to help. 5.\r\n                Tackle What’s Weighing on Your Mind When unresolved tasks linger\r\n                in your mind, they drain your energy and focus. Whether it’s a\r\n                personal responsibility like fixing your car or a professional\r\n                challenge like completing a complex report, make it your mission\r\n                to address these tasks promptly. Clearing mental clutter allows\r\n                you to redirect your energy toward other meaningful activities.\r\n                6. Use the T.A.R. Principle: Trash, Action, Reference Emails,\r\n                documents, and other information can pile up quickly, creating a\r\n                constant source of distraction. Use the T.A.R. method to\r\n                categorize everything you encounter: Trash: If something is\r\n                irrelevant or unnecessary, discard it immediately. Action: If an\r\n                item requires your attention, identify the next step and add it\r\n                to your to-do list. Reference: If it’s something you may need\r\n                later, file it in an organized system for easy access. This\r\n                system keeps you focused on actionable tasks while reducing time\r\n                spent sifting through clutter. Time management isn’t about\r\n                filling every moment with tasks—it’s about aligning your actions\r\n                with your values and goals. Small, consistent changes to how you\r\n                approach your day can lead to significant improvements in both\r\n                productivity and satisfaction. Remember, the goal isn’t just to\r\n                do more but to do what matters most. By adopting these six\r\n                golden rules, you’ll take control of your time and create a more\r\n                balanced, fulfilling life.\r\n              </p>\r\n              </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </article>\r\n    `;\nconst markupArticle2 = `\r\n             <img\r\n            srcset=\"\r\n              ${walls_mobile_1x} 1x,\r\n              ${walls_mobile_2x} 2x\r\n            \"\r\n            src=\"${walls_mobile_1x}\"\r\n            alt=\"notes on the wall\"\r\n            class=\"image-for-article\"\r\n          />\r\n          <article class=\"article-content\">\r\n            <h3 class=\"article-title\">\r\n              Best Time Management Techniques: Find What Works for You.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <article class=\"article-text \">\r\n              <p>\r\n                The key to better time management lies in understanding your\r\n                specific needs—whether you’re looking to organize work tasks,\r\n                streamline study sessions, or focus on personal goals. Below are\r\n                some of the most effective time management techniques you can\r\n                adopt, depending on your unique challenges and aspirations.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                Primarily focused on management tasks. Choose Your Technique The\r\n                best time management method depends on your goals and work\r\n                style. Start with one that resonates with your needs and adapt\r\n                it as necessary. Whether you're focusing on personal growth,\r\n                professional tasks, or team projects, adopting these techniques\r\n                can help you achieve more with less stress. 1. Pomodoro\r\n                Technique The Pomodoro Technique divides your work into\r\n                25-minute focused sessions followed by 5-minute breaks. After\r\n                completing four sessions, you take a longer 15–20 minute break.\r\n                How It Works: Choose a task. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Work on\r\n                the task until the timer rings. Take a 5-minute break. After\r\n                four cycles, enjoy a 20-minute break. Best For: Avoiding\r\n                burnout. Managing distractions. Tackling procrastination. Pros:\r\n                Encourages intense focus. Helps maintain energy levels. Cons:\r\n                Fixed intervals may disrupt creative flow. 2. Kanban Method\r\n                Kanban offers a visual system for tracking tasks through a board\r\n                with columns like To Do, In Progress, and Done. How It Works:\r\n                List all your tasks in the Backlog column. Move tasks to To Do,\r\n                then to In Progress, and finally to Done. Focus on moving tasks\r\n                steadily across the board. Best For: Visual learners. Managing\r\n                multiple ongoing projects. Pros: Clear overview of task status.\r\n                Customizable to suit personal workflows. Cons: Lacks\r\n                time-specific scheduling. 3. Getting Things Done (GTD) This\r\n                method involves capturing and organizing every task to create\r\n                actionable to-do lists. How It Works: Write down all tasks.\r\n                Clarify which tasks are actionable. Organize tasks by context or\r\n                category. Regularly review your lists to update priorities. Act\r\n                on the tasks with clear next steps. Best For: Clearing mental\r\n                clutter. Prioritizing tasks. Pros: Provides structure to your\r\n                workflow.

Eat That\r\n                Frog This method emphasizes tackling your hardest or most\r\n                important task first. How It Works: Identify your “frog” (the\r\n                task you’re dreading or that has the most impact). Do it first\r\n                thing in the morning. Move on to smaller tasks after completing\r\n                the big one. Best For: Overcoming procrastination. Prioritizing\r\n                high-impact work. Pros: Builds momentum for the rest of the day.\r\n                Simplifies prioritization. Cons: May feel overwhelming to start\r\n                with a challenging task. 5. Timeboxing Timeboxing involves\r\n                assigning specific time slots to tasks. How It Works: List your\r\n                tasks. Allocate a specific amount of time to each task. Stick to\r\n                the schedule. Best For: Breaking large projects into manageable\r\n                chunks. Keeping track of small tasks. Pros: Encourages focus and\r\n                accountability. Helps manage multiple responsibilities. Cons:\r\n                Interruptions can disrupt the schedule. 6. Time Blocking Time\r\n                blocking allocates distinct blocks of time for specific tasks,\r\n                often using a calendar. How It Works: Create a detailed schedule\r\n                in your calendar. Assign blocks of time to tasks based on their\r\n                priority. Include breaks in your schedule. Best For:\r\n                Comprehensive day planning. Focusing on deep work. Pros:\r\n                Encourages focused work. Promotes better control over your day.\r\n                Cons: Requires adjustments for unexpected interruptions. 7.\r\n                Inbox Zero This technique aims to manage your email inbox by\r\n                reducing the number of unread or pending messages to zero. How\r\n                It Works: Schedule specific times to check your inbox. Address\r\n                emails immediately: reply, delete, archive, or delegate.\r\n                Organize emails into folders for action or reference. Best For:\r\n                Keeping email under control. Reducing distraction from constant\r\n                notifications. Pros: Reduces email clutter. Allocates focused\r\n                time for inbox management. Cons: Time-consuming to implement\r\n                fully. 8. Who’s Got the Monkey? This method focuses on\r\n                delegating tasks effectively, making it especially useful for\r\n                managers. How It Works: Identify tasks (“monkeys”) and who\r\n                should handle them. Assign tasks with clear expectations. Follow\r\n                up to ensure progress. Best For: Delegating responsibilities.\r\n                Improving team productivity. Pros: Increases team\r\n                accountability. Frees up time for strategic priorities.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </article>\r\n          `;\nconst markupArticle3 = `\r\n          <img\r\n            srcset=\"\r\n              ${folders_mobile_1x} 1x,\r\n              ${folders_mobile_2x} 2x\r\n            \"${folders_mobile_1x}\r\n            alt=\"table\"\r\n            class=\"image-for-article\"\r\n          />\r\n          <article class=\"article-content\">\r\n            <h3 class=\"article-title\">\r\n              Explore different approaches to Time Management Styles.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <article class=\"article-text\">\r\n              <p>\r\n                Not all time management techniques work for everyone. The way we\r\n                approach tasks, our habits, and how we deal with\r\n                responsibilities define our time management style. Each style\r\n                has its strengths but also comes with specific challenges.\r\n                Here's an overview of six common time management styles and\r\n                their issues.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                1. Time Martyr Time martyrs prioritize others' needs over their\r\n                own. They often fill their schedules with tasks for others,\r\n                avoiding their own responsibilities, which feel overwhelming.\r\n                This behavior might bring external validation but neglects\r\n                personal growth and satisfaction. Common Issues: Multitasking\r\n                Missed deadlines Ineffective scheduling Skipping breaks 2.\r\n                Procrastinator Procrastinators delay tasks, often claiming they\r\n                work better under pressure. While this approach may sometimes\r\n                yield results, it frequently leads to stress, anxiety, and\r\n                subpar outcomes. Common Issues: Missed deadlines Ineffective\r\n                scheduling Multitasking 3. Distractor Distractors have good\r\n                intentions but struggle with focus. They’re easily sidetracked\r\n                by interruptions, like impromptu chats, phone calls, or\r\n                unplanned tasks, which prevents them from completing their work\r\n                effectively. Common Issues: Multitasking Missed deadlines\r\n                Ineffective scheduling 4. Underestimator Underestimators often\r\n                misjudge how long tasks will take. They optimistically set\r\n                deadlines that are difficult to meet, leading to rushed work and\r\n                unmet expectations. Common Issues: Missed deadlines Ineffective\r\n                scheduling 5. Firefighter Firefighters thrive on urgency and\r\n                constantly put out \"fires\" — tackling problems as they arise.\r\n                While they appear busy and productive, this reactive approach\r\n                can lead to burnout and a lack of focus on long-term goals.\r\n                Common Issues: Missed deadlines Skipping breaks Ineffective\r\n                scheduling 6. Perfectionist Perfectionists strive for flawless\r\n                results, which often makes them overwork tasks. While their\r\n                commitment to quality is admirable, their inability to stop\r\n                tweaking can cause delays, missed deadlines, and even burnout.\r\n                Common Issues: Missed deadlines Skipping breaks How to Overcome\r\n                Challenges Each time management style has room for improvement.\r\n                The key is identifying your challenges and adopting time\r\n                management techniques that address them: Time Martyrs can learn\r\n                to say “no” and prioritize their own tasks using techniques like\r\n                Eat That Frog or Time Blocking. Procrastinators may benefit from\r\n                structured approaches like the Pomodoro Technique to break tasks\r\n                into manageable segments. Distractors can use Timeboxing or\r\n                create focused environments by silencing notifications and\r\n                minimizing interruptions. Under estimators should plan with\r\n                SMART goals, breaking tasks into smaller, realistic steps.\r\n                Firefighters can gain control with visual tools like Kanban\r\n                boards, focusing on long-term priorities. Perfectionists should\r\n                embrace Timeboxing, which sets clear boundaries on how long to\r\n                spend on a task. By recognizing your time management style and\r\n                addressing its pitfalls, you can develop more effective habits\r\n                and achieve a healthier work-life balance.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </article>\r\n         `;\nfunction renderArticles() {\n    const articleContainer1 = document.querySelector(\".article-one\");\n    const articleContainer2 = document.querySelector(\".article-two\");\n    const articleContainer3 = document.querySelector(\".article-three\");\n    articleContainer1.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", markupArticle1);\n    articleContainer2.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", markupArticle2);\n    articleContainer3.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", markupArticle3);\n}\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", () => {\n    renderArticles();\n});\n//# sourceMappingURL=articles.js.map","import table_mobile_1x from \"../src/images/table_mobile_1x.jpg\";\r\nimport table_mobile_2x from \"../src/images/table_mobile_2x.jpg\";\r\nimport walls_mobile_1x from \"../src/images/walls_mobile_1x.jpg\";\r\nimport walls_mobile_2x from \"../src/images/walls_mobile_2x.jpg\";\r\nimport folders_mobile_1x from \"../src/images/folders_mobile_1x.jpg\";\r\nimport folders_mobile_2x from \"../src/images/folders_mobile_2x.jpg\";\r\n\r\nconst markupArticle1: string = `\r\n              <img\r\n            srcset =\"${table_mobile_1x} 1x,\r\n              ${table_mobile_2x} 2x\r\n            \"\r\n            src=\"${table_mobile_1x}\"\r\n            alt=\"notes on the wall\"\r\n            class=\"image-for-article\"\r\n          />\r\n          <article class=\"article-content\">\r\n            <h3 class=\"article-title\">\r\n              Six golden Rules for Better Time Management.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <article class=\"article-text\">\r\n              <p>\r\n                Time management isn’t about controlling the clock—it’s about\r\n                managing yourself. There’s an old adage that says you can’t\r\n                manage time, but you can manage your actions. This sentiment\r\n                holds the key to productivity: making small, intentional changes\r\n                to your habits to focus on what truly matters.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"test\">\r\n                <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                The goal of effective time management is not to cram more tasks\r\n                into your day but to prioritize the right tasks—the ones that\r\n                drive meaningful results. By doing so, you’ll not only feel more\r\n                fulfilled but also experience benefits like career growth,\r\n                financial rewards, or simply a bit of extra free time. Think you\r\n                don’t have time to improve your time management skills? Think\r\n                again! Here are six practical strategies to tweak your habits\r\n                and see real results. 1. Embrace Change with an Open Mind The\r\n                foundation of better time management lies in your willingness to\r\n                change. If you’re resistant to trying new approaches, you’ll\r\n                remain stuck in old patterns that don’t serve you. Begin by\r\n                acknowledging that your current habits might need adjustment,\r\n                and commit to experimenting with strategies that can help you\r\n                become more efficient and focused. 2. Treat Time Like Money Time\r\n                is your most valuable resource—it’s finite and irreplaceable.\r\n                Unlike money, you can’t earn more of it. You have just 1,440\r\n                minutes each day, so think about how you’re spending them. Are\r\n                you investing your time in activities that align with your goals\r\n                and values? Whether it’s at work or in your personal life, make\r\n                deliberate choices that prioritize what truly matters to you. 3.\r\n                Prioritize Like You’re Going on Vacation Think about how you\r\n                prepare for a vacation. You make a long list of tasks, then\r\n                narrow it down ruthlessly, focusing only on the essentials as\r\n                your departure date approaches. If you applied this mindset\r\n                every day, you’d accomplish far more of what’s important. Start\r\n                each morning by identifying your top three priorities and let go\r\n                of tasks that don’t contribute to significant results. 4. Weigh\r\n                the Consequences Before Saying “Yes” We often agree to new tasks\r\n                without fully considering their impact. The next time someone\r\n                asks for your help, pause and think: What will happen if I don’t\r\n                take on this responsibility? Can I realistically deliver on this\r\n                commitment without compromising my other priorities? By saying\r\n                “No” thoughtfully, you’ll not only protect your time but also\r\n                build a reputation for reliability when you do agree to help. 5.\r\n                Tackle What’s Weighing on Your Mind When unresolved tasks linger\r\n                in your mind, they drain your energy and focus. Whether it’s a\r\n                personal responsibility like fixing your car or a professional\r\n                challenge like completing a complex report, make it your mission\r\n                to address these tasks promptly. Clearing mental clutter allows\r\n                you to redirect your energy toward other meaningful activities.\r\n                6. Use the T.A.R. Principle: Trash, Action, Reference Emails,\r\n                documents, and other information can pile up quickly, creating a\r\n                constant source of distraction. Use the T.A.R. method to\r\n                categorize everything you encounter: Trash: If something is\r\n                irrelevant or unnecessary, discard it immediately. Action: If an\r\n                item requires your attention, identify the next step and add it\r\n                to your to-do list. Reference: If it’s something you may need\r\n                later, file it in an organized system for easy access. This\r\n                system keeps you focused on actionable tasks while reducing time\r\n                spent sifting through clutter. Time management isn’t about\r\n                filling every moment with tasks—it’s about aligning your actions\r\n                with your values and goals. Small, consistent changes to how you\r\n                approach your day can lead to significant improvements in both\r\n                productivity and satisfaction. Remember, the goal isn’t just to\r\n                do more but to do what matters most. By adopting these six\r\n                golden rules, you’ll take control of your time and create a more\r\n                balanced, fulfilling life.\r\n              </p>\r\n              </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </article>\r\n    `;\r\n\r\nconst markupArticle2: string = `\r\n             <img\r\n            srcset=\"\r\n              ${walls_mobile_1x} 1x,\r\n              ${walls_mobile_2x} 2x\r\n            \"\r\n            src=\"${walls_mobile_1x}\"\r\n            alt=\"notes on the wall\"\r\n            class=\"image-for-article\"\r\n          />\r\n          <article class=\"article-content\">\r\n            <h3 class=\"article-title\">\r\n              Best Time Management Techniques: Find What Works for You.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <article class=\"article-text \">\r\n              <p>\r\n                The key to better time management lies in understanding your\r\n                specific needs—whether you’re looking to organize work tasks,\r\n                streamline study sessions, or focus on personal goals. Below are\r\n                some of the most effective time management techniques you can\r\n                adopt, depending on your unique challenges and aspirations.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                Primarily focused on management tasks. Choose Your Technique The\r\n                best time management method depends on your goals and work\r\n                style. Start with one that resonates with your needs and adapt\r\n                it as necessary. Whether you're focusing on personal growth,\r\n                professional tasks, or team projects, adopting these techniques\r\n                can help you achieve more with less stress. 1. Pomodoro\r\n                Technique The Pomodoro Technique divides your work into\r\n                25-minute focused sessions followed by 5-minute breaks. After\r\n                completing four sessions, you take a longer 15–20 minute break.\r\n                How It Works: Choose a task. Set a timer for 25 minutes. Work on\r\n                the task until the timer rings. Take a 5-minute break. After\r\n                four cycles, enjoy a 20-minute break. Best For: Avoiding\r\n                burnout. Managing distractions. Tackling procrastination. Pros:\r\n                Encourages intense focus. Helps maintain energy levels. Cons:\r\n                Fixed intervals may disrupt creative flow. 2.

How It Works:\r\n                List all your tasks in the Backlog column. Move tasks to To Do,\r\n                then to In Progress, and finally to Done. Focus on moving tasks\r\n                steadily across the board. Best For: Visual learners. Managing\r\n                multiple ongoing projects. Pros: Clear overview of task status.\r\n                Customizable to suit personal workflows. Cons: Lacks\r\n                time-specific scheduling. 3. Getting Things Done (GTD) This\r\n                method involves capturing and organizing every task to create\r\n                actionable to-do lists. How It Works: Write down all tasks.\r\n                Clarify which tasks are actionable. Organize tasks by context or\r\n                category. Regularly review your lists to update priorities.

Eat That\r\n                Frog This method emphasizes tackling your hardest or most\r\n                important task first. How It Works: Identify your “frog” (the\r\n                task you’re dreading or that has the most impact). Do it first\r\n                thing in the morning. Move on to smaller tasks after completing\r\n                the big one. Best For: Overcoming procrastination. Prioritizing\r\n                high-impact work. Pros: Builds momentum for the rest of the day.\r\n                Simplifies prioritization. Cons: May feel overwhelming to start\r\n                with a challenging task. 5. Timeboxing Timeboxing involves\r\n                assigning specific time slots to tasks. How It Works: List your\r\n                tasks. Allocate a specific amount of time to each task. Stick to\r\n                the schedule. Best For: Breaking large projects into manageable\r\n                chunks. Keeping track of small tasks. Pros: Encourages focus and\r\n                accountability. Helps manage multiple responsibilities. Cons:\r\n                Interruptions can disrupt the schedule. 6. Time Blocking Time\r\n                blocking allocates distinct blocks of time for specific tasks,\r\n                often using a calendar. How It Works: Create a detailed schedule\r\n                in your calendar. Assign blocks of time to tasks based on their\r\n                priority. Include breaks in your schedule. Best For:\r\n                Comprehensive day planning. Focusing on deep work. Pros:\r\n                Encourages focused work. Promotes better control over your day.\r\n                Cons: Requires adjustments for unexpected interruptions. 7.\r\n                Inbox Zero This technique aims to manage your email inbox by\r\n                reducing the number of unread or pending messages to zero. How\r\n                It Works: Schedule specific times to check your inbox. Address\r\n                emails immediately: reply, delete, archive, or delegate.\r\n                Organize emails into folders for action or reference. Best For:\r\n                Keeping email under control. Reducing distraction from constant\r\n                notifications. Pros: Reduces email clutter. Allocates focused\r\n                time for inbox management. Cons: Time-consuming to implement\r\n                fully. 8. Who’s Got the Monkey? This method focuses on\r\n                delegating tasks effectively, making it especially useful for\r\n                managers. How It Works: Identify tasks (“monkeys”) and who\r\n                should handle them. Assign tasks with clear expectations. Follow\r\n                up to ensure progress. Best For: Delegating responsibilities.\r\n                Improving team productivity. Pros: Increases team\r\n                accountability. Frees up time for strategic priorities.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </article>\r\n          `;\r\n\r\nconst markupArticle3: string = `\r\n          <img\r\n            srcset=\"\r\n              ${folders_mobile_1x} 1x,\r\n              ${folders_mobile_2x} 2x\r\n            \"${folders_mobile_1x}\r\n            alt=\"table\"\r\n            class=\"image-for-article\"\r\n          />\r\n          <article class=\"article-content\">\r\n            <h3 class=\"article-title\">\r\n              Explore different approaches to Time Management Styles.\r\n            </h3>\r\n            <article class=\"article-text\">\r\n              <p>\r\n                Not all time management techniques work for everyone. The way we\r\n                approach tasks, our habits, and how we deal with\r\n                responsibilities define our time management style. Each style\r\n                has its strengths but also comes with specific challenges.\r\n                Here's an overview of six common time management styles and\r\n                their issues.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p class=\"article-load-more\">\r\n                1. Time Martyr Time martyrs prioritize others' needs over their\r\n                own. They often fill their schedules with tasks for others,\r\n                avoiding their own responsibilities, which feel overwhelming.\r\n                This behavior might bring external validation but neglects\r\n                personal growth and satisfaction. Common Issues: Multitasking\r\n                Missed deadlines Ineffective scheduling Skipping breaks 2.\r\n                Procrastinator Procrastinators delay tasks, often claiming they\r\n                work better under pressure. While this approach may sometimes\r\n                yield results, it frequently leads to stress, anxiety, and\r\n                subpar outcomes. Common Issues: Missed deadlines Ineffective\r\n                scheduling Multitasking 3. Distractor Distractors have good\r\n                intentions but struggle with focus. They’re easily sidetracked\r\n                by interruptions, like impromptu chats, phone calls, or\r\n                unplanned tasks, which prevents them from completing their work\r\n                effectively. Common Issues: Multitasking Missed deadlines\r\n                Ineffective scheduling 4. Underestimator Underestimators often\r\n                misjudge how long tasks will take. They optimistically set\r\n                deadlines that are difficult to meet, leading to rushed work and\r\n                unmet expectations. Common Issues: Missed deadlines Ineffective\r\n                scheduling 5. Firefighter Firefighters thrive on urgency and\r\n                constantly put out \"fires\" — tackling problems as they arise.\r\n                While they appear busy and productive, this reactive approach\r\n                can lead to burnout and a lack of focus on long-term goals.\r\n                Common Issues: Missed deadlines Skipping breaks Ineffective\r\n                scheduling 6. Perfectionist Perfectionists strive for flawless\r\n                results, which often makes them overwork tasks. While their\r\n                commitment to quality is admirable, their inability to stop\r\n                tweaking can cause delays, missed deadlines, and even burnout.\r\n                Common Issues: Missed deadlines Skipping breaks How to Overcome\r\n                Challenges Each time management style has room for improvement.\r\n                The key is identifying your challenges and adopting time\r\n                management techniques that address them: Time Martyrs can learn\r\n                to say “no” and prioritize their own tasks using techniques like\r\n                Eat That Frog or Time Blocking. Procrastinators may benefit from\r\n                structured approaches like the Pomodoro Technique to break tasks\r\n                into manageable segments. Distractors can use Timeboxing or\r\n                create focused environments by silencing notifications and\r\n                minimizing interruptions. Under estimators should plan with\r\n                SMART goals, breaking tasks into smaller, realistic steps.\r\n                Firefighters can gain control with visual tools like Kanban\r\n                boards, focusing on long-term priorities. Perfectionists should\r\n                embrace Timeboxing, which sets clear boundaries on how long to\r\n                spend on a task. By recognizing your time management style and\r\n                addressing its pitfalls, you can develop more effective habits\r\n                and achieve a healthier work-life balance.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </article>\r\n         `;\r\n\r\nfunction renderArticles(): void {\r\n  const articleContainer1 = document.querySelector(\r\n    \".article-one\"\r\n  ) as HTMLElement;\r\n\r\n  const articleContainer2 = document.querySelector(\r\n    \".article-two\"\r\n  ) as HTMLHtmlElement;\r\n\r\n  const articleContainer3 = document.querySelector(\r\n    \".article-three\"\r\n  ) as HTMLHtmlElement;\r\n\r\n  articleContainer1.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", markupArticle1);\r\n  articleContainer2.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", markupArticle2);\r\n  articleContainer3.insertAdjacentHTML(\"afterbegin\", markupArticle3);\r\n}\r\n\r\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", () => {\r\n  renderArticles();\r\n});\r\n","module.exports = new __parcel__URL__(\"table_mobile_1x.85ae97ab.jpg\").toString();","module.exports = new __parcel__URL__(\"table_mobile_2x.4ced3fe3.jpg\").toString();","module.exports = new __parcel__URL__(\"walls_mobile_1x.b55aa355.jpg\").toString();","module.exports = new __parcel__URL__(\"walls_mobile_2x.82a774d1.jpg\").toString();","module.exports = new __parcel__URL__(\"folders_mobile_1x.cc585da2.jpg\").toString();","module.exports = new __parcel__URL__(\"folders_mobile_2x.452d39d9.jpg\").toString();"],"names":["$parcel$interopDefault","a","__esModule","default","$parcel$global","globalThis","$parcel$modules","$parcel$inits","parcelRequire","id","exports","init","module","call","err","Error","code","register","parcelRegister","Object","defineProperty","get","$18c11f3350a906ea$export$6503ec6e8aabbaf","set","v","enumerable","configurable","$18c11f3350a906ea$var$mapping","Map","baseUrl","manifest","i","length","path","URL","url","toString","JSON","parse","$51e7c54d8aaccaec$exports","$35b4eb2608136137$exports","$507bc6b3fc80ef19$exports","$92cf4acfbb3cdabf$exports","$da0b303646fa662c$exports","$3c4ac21ff5438d62$exports","$0057781f4d676bcb$var$markupArticle1","$0057781f4d676bcb$var$markupArticle2","$0057781f4d676bcb$var$markupArticle3","document","addEventListener","$0057781f4d676bcb$var$renderArticles","articleContainer1","querySelector","articleContainer2","articleContainer3","insertAdjacentHTML"],"version":3,"file":"index.7f81450b.js.map"}
